, "\tThe path module contains several helper functions to help make path manipulation easier."
, "\t"
, "\tThe first function worth mentioning is path.normalize. This function takes a path (in the form of a string) and strips it of duplicate slashes and normalizes directory abbreviations, like '.' for 'this directory' and '..' for 'one level up'. For example:"
, "\t"
, "\t    > var path = require('path');".green
, "\t    > path.normalize('/a/.///b/d/../c/')".green

, "\t    > path.join('/a/.', './//b/', 'd/../c/')".green

, "\t"
, "\t"
, "\tThere are three functions which are used to extract the various parts of the path name: basename, extname, and dirname. "
, "\t- basename returns the last portion of the path passed in. "
, "\t- extname returns the extension of the last portion. Generally for directories, extname just returns ''. "
, "\t- Finally, dirname returns everything that basename does not return."
, "\t"
, "\tFor example:"
, "\t"
, "\t    > var path = require('path')".green
, "\t    > var a = '/a/b/c.html'".green

, "\t    > path.basename(a, path.extname(a))".green

, "\texists takes a callback as its second parameter, to which is returned a boolean representing the existance of the file."
, "\t"
, "\texistsSync, on the other hand, checks the given path synchronously, returning the boolean directly. In Node.js, you will typically want to use the asynchronous functions for most file system I/O - the synchronous versions will block your entire process until they finish."
, "\t"
, "\tBlocking isn't always a bad thing. Checking the existence of a vital configuration file synchronously makes sense, for example - it doesn't matter much if your process is blocking for something it can't run without! Conversely, though, in a busy HTTP server, any per-request file I/O MUST be asynchronous, or else you'll be responding to requests one by one. See the article on asynchronous operations for more details."
